# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-with-ILP-and-SA

This project is the final project for the course "Numerical Methods-Principles, Algorithms and Applications"(00136540) at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. It contains implementations of two algorithms to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP): Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Simulated Annealing (SA). The project is structured into two main directories: CVRP_Simulated_Annealing and VRP_Simulated_Annealing.

## Directory Structure
CVRP_Simulated_Annealing: Contains MATLAB scripts for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Simulated Annealing.
VRP_Simulated_Annealing: Contains MATLAB scripts for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Simulated Annealing.
report: Contains the LaTeX source files for the project report.
Running the Code
To run the code, you need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. Open the MATLAB scripts in the CVRP_Simulated_Annealing or VRP_Simulated_Annealing directories and run them.

## Report
The report provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the implemented algorithms, and the results. It is written in LaTeX and can be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.
